AudioRom enter the live arena, utilising their own custom designed consoles. The audience is invited to interact and explore their own aesthetic perceptions of the music and graphics by playing, effecting, remixing and creating.Shifting away from the constraints of joy pads and ‘point ‘n’ click’ technology, AudioRom remove the point of control away from the object, allowing the audiences to enter reactive, futuristic, sensory based environments. For example, you can become the controller by just moving your hand in mid-air or intersecting a light beam. The consoles become non-contact, making the whole experience more sensual and immersive.AudioRom hit the road for an international summer tour, taking their installations to various events, including festivals, galleries, clubs etc.For up to date information on where AudioRom are performing check out :http://www.audiorom.com/text/EVENTS
